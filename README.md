## What the heck is this

an unofficial fork of spawncamping-wallhack designed to tweak it more for StepMania 5.3

skulk: group of foxes
Requirements: StepMania 5.3 or later.

---
### Issues
 * Mouse input is broken and needs to be migrated to the new 5.3 input code.
 * In general a lot of things should be migrated to 5.3 modules so we can have saner implementations of things like SL-OutFox.
 * PIU Scores are broken since there's no way to get the total # of checkpoints.
 * Courses are disabled.

### Usage Guide (Not updated for the 5.0.12 branch yet.)   
This is tad outdated now. I'll start updating this over the next few days.

#### Global
* **Theme Color**  
The main theme color can be set by entering "Color Config" from the title menu.  
From there, you can then set the hexadecimal value to a color of your liking.   
To completely reset to default values, delete `%appdata%\StepMania 5\Save\_fallback_config\colorConfig.lua`   


* **Avatars**   
You can set an avatar to a profile that is then displayed throughout the theme. I changed it to use the native StepMania 5.3 avatar module, so if you have one set up in Soundwaves it should work here too.


* **Score Types**   
  ```Options → Theme Options → Default ScoreType```   
  Currently, the theme supports the 3 most commonly used scoring methods within the keyboard community.
  They are as follows:  

  |ScoreType|W1|W2|W3|W4|W5|Miss|OK|NG|HitMine|   
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|   
  |PS/Percentage Scoring (oni EX) <sup>default</sup>|3|2|1|0|0|0|3|0|-2|   
  |DP/Dance Points (MAX2)|2|2|1|0|-4|-8|6|0|-8|   
  |MIGS|3|2|1|0|-4|-8|6|0|-8|   
  Scores are calculated dynamically separate from the game engine's scoring. (aka: everything is done in lua) So any preferences set regarding score weights will have no effect.   
  DP Score will always be used for letter grade calculations regardless of the scoretype set.
  
* **Rate Filter**   
  ```Options → Theme Options → Rate Sort```   
  This option is already enabled by default. When enabled, instead of displaying all scores (with different rate mods) in a single scoreboard, all the scores will be separated by the rate mods that have been used. 

* **Clear Types**   
  The theme uses iidx-esque cleartypes because... huur durrr lr2 wannabe theme.   
  Any life-difficulty based clear types (e.g.`Easy Hard EX-Hard`) requires a ghost data that corresponds to the score. It will default to `Clear` when not available.

* **Backgrounds**   
  On ScreenSelectMusic and ScreenEvaluation, it will show the current song's background by default. It can be turned off at ```Options → Theme Options → Show Background```   
  It also has a parallax effect with the mouse just because it looks cool on osu..! It can be turned off at ```Options → Theme Options → Move Background```  
  * **Adding Custom backgrounds for ScreenEvaluation**   
    The theme also allows users to display their own images/waifu pics in the evaluation screen instead of the song's background image.   
     First enable the option from ```Options → Theme Options → Eval Background Type``` and set it to either ```Clear+Grade Background``` or ```Grade Background only``` depending on what you want.   

     Then open up the main theme folder, and navigate to this directory:   
     ```<sc-wh Theme Folder>\Graphics\Eval background```   
     
     **DO NOT DELETE**   
     ```Grade_Cleared``` or    
     ```Grade_Failed``` folders   
     *you may remove the placeholder background images inside if you wish.*   
     
     Images in "Grade_Failed" will be loaded for failing scores.   
     Images in "Grade_Cleared" will be loaded for all passing scores.   
     
     In addition, to add backgrounds that are grade-specific, (e.g. only shows upon AA)
     create additional folders with the SM's grade tier as the title.   
     (```Grade_Tier01``` or AAAA has already been done for you as an example)
     
     The theme will then load the backgrounds from the ```Grade_Cleared``` and the ```Grade_Tierxx``` folder.
     (If the grade specific folder is empty while set to ```Grade Background Only```, the theme will revert back to grade_cleared folder for background images.)
    
* **Tips and Quotes**   
  ```Options → Theme Options → Tip Type```   
  The theme displays *potentially helpful* tips usually on the bottom center of the screen.
  You can either turn it off or set to `Random Phrases` for memes.

#### ScreenSelectMusic
All available tabs in this screen can be accessed either by clicking on the tabs themselves, or pressing ```1 - 5``` on the keyboard for each tab respectively.   
Some Tabs will be disabled for 2 player modes.

  Contains slightly more detailed information of the currently selected simfile.

  Pressing ```<Select>+<EffectDown>``` and ```<Select>+<EffectUp>``` will scroll through available rates.

  Probably a summary of the profile once I get around adding stuff to this.

  * **osu! Style (Old)** <sup>Default</sup> - Preview plays from SAMPLESTART to the end of the song. Then the preview loops from the start to the end of the song.
